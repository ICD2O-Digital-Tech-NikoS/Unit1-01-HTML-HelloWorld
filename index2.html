  <h1>Drawing</h1>
  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is drawing. I wasn't very good at drawing realistic things or perspective as much, so I
    decided to use that to my advantage, and I started drawing monsters and abnormal things which I ended up being very
    good at.</p>
  <h3>Animation and 3D models</h3>
  <p>If I end up in game design which could be the case, or even if I dont, one thing that I would really like to learn
    how to do is digital 3D modelling so that I can create my ideas in 3D instead of just in 2D and on paper.</p>
